Drug Name: Actemra
Generic Name: Pronunciation: ac-tem-ra

Pediatric patients (aged 2 years to 18 years) with COVID-19 still have access to Actrema under emergency use authorization (EUA). Actrema is a monoclonal antibody that blocks a protein in your body called interleukin-6 (IL-6).  If this protein is activated, it causes your immune system to be overactive which results in inflammation and the signs and symptoms of autoimmune disease. As Actrema blocks the interleukin-6 receptor, this is how it is thought to reduce the immune system from being overactive, so there is less inflammation and a reduction in the signs and symptoms of autoimmune diseases. At a more technical level the mode of action (MOA) of Actrema is that it binds to IL-6 receptors (sIL-6R and mIL-6R) which have been shown to inhibit IL-6-mediated signaling through these receptors. Interleukin-6 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that is made by a variety of cell types including T- and B-cells, lymphocytes, monocytes and fibroblasts.

Description: Atorvastatin is medication used to lower cholesterol and triglycerides (fats) levels to help prevent prevent heart disease, angina (chest pain), strokes, and heart attacks. Atorvastatin calcium belongs to a class of medications called HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins). Atorvastatin calcium works by slowing the production of cholesterol in the body to decrease the amount of cholesterol that may build up on the walls of the arteries and block blood flow to the heart, brain, and other parts of the body. Atorvastatin is used together with diet, weight loss, and exercise to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke and to decrease the chance that heart surgery will be needed in people who have heart disease or who are at risk of developing heart disease. Atorvastatin is also used to lower the amount of fatty substances such as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol ('bad cholesterol') and triglycerides in the blood and to increase the amount of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ('good cholesterol') in the blood. Atorvastatin may also be used to decrease the amount of cholesterol and other fatty substances in the blood in children and teenagers 10 to 17 years of age who have familial heterozygous hypercholesterolemia (an inherited condition in which cholesterol cannot be removed from the body normally). Accumulation of cholesterol and fats along the walls of your arteries (a process known as atherosclerosis) decreases blood flow and, therefore, the oxygen supply to your heart, brain, and other parts of your body. Lowering your blood level of cholesterol and fats with atorvastatin has been shown to prevent heart disease, angina (chest pain), strokes, and heart attacks. Common atorvastatin side effects may include pain in your bones, spine, joints, or muscles, pain and burning when you urinate, painful urination, muscle spasms, upset stomach , trouble sleeping, stuffy nose, runny nose, sore throat, diarrhea , nausea , or pain in your arms or legs.

Drug class: VMAT2 inhibitors
Description: Austedo and Austedo XR (deutetrabenazine) are used to treat chorea (sudden involuntary movements) caused by Huntington's disease (an inherited disease that causes the progressive breakdown of nerve cells in the brain). Deutetrabenazine is not a cure for Huntington's disease and will not treat other symptoms of this condition. Austedo is also used in adults to treat symptoms of tardive dyskinesia (TD), a nervous system disorder. Tardive dyskinesia causes repetitive uncontrolled muscle movements, usually in the face (chewing, lip smacking, frowning, tongue movement, blinking or eye movement). Austedo belongs to a class of medications called vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) inhibitors. It works by changing the activity of certain natural substances in the brain that affect nerves and muscles. Austedo is taken twice daily, and Austedo XR (extended-release tablet) is taken once daily. Body movement or motor function is controlled in the brain by nerve cells (neurons) that speak to each other by passing chemical messengers (neurotransmitters) from one nerve cell to another nerve cell. In movement disorders such as Huntington’s disease and tardive dyskinesia there can be a problem with this system and by lowering the amount of chemical messengers between the nerve cells you relieve the uncontrolled movements. A protein called VMAT2 controls how much chemical messenger is stored in the nerve cell and how much is released. The VMAT2 inhibitors block VMAT2 which means there is a lower amount of neurotransmitter available and therefore reduces the unwanted body movements.

Drug Name: Auvelity
Generic Name: Pronunciation: aw-VEHL-ah-tee
Generic name: bupropion and dextromethorphan
Dosage form: extended-release tablets

Enhertu works by blocking HER2 receptors on cancer cells to prevent cancer cells from multiplying, which slows the cancer growth and progression, and then its second action is to damage or kill the cancer cells. Enhertu is made up of two cancer-fighting medicines joined together, a monoclonal antibody (fam-trastuzumab) and a chemotherapy drug (topoisomerase I inhibitor). Enhertu is an HER2-directed antibody and topoisomerase inhibitor conjugate. Enhertu is an HER2 inhibitor which is a targeted therapy used to treat cancer. The FDA first approved Enhertu on December 20, 2019. Enhertu is FDA-approved for use in adult patients who have: Breast cancer that is (HER2)-positive that is not removable by surgery or has spread and has already had a specific anti-HER2-based regimen. Breast cancer that is HER2-low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH-) that is not removable by surgery or has spread to other parts of your body, and who have already had chemotherapy for cancer that has spread or cancer has returned within 6 months of finishing adjuvant chemotherapy. Stomach cancer that is HER2-positive that is gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma cancer, and you have already had a trastuzumab-based regimen and cancer has spread to areas near your stomach (locally advanced) or has spread to other parts of your body (metastatic). Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that has activating HER2 (ERBB2) mutations that cannot be removed by surgery or cancer that has spread to other parts of your body (metastatic), and you have already had systemic therapy, and activating HER2 (ERBB2) mutations have been detected by an FDA-approved test. Enhertu (fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki) is not the same medicine as trastuzumab ( Herceptin , Herzuma , Kanjinti , Ogivri , Ontruzant , Trazimera ).

Enhertu (fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki) is not the same medicine as Kadcyla ( ado-trastuzumab emtansine ) which has a different antibody-drug conjugate. Some cancer cells have too many copies of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) gene, which makes a protein called the HER2, these cancers are called HER2 positive.Â  HER2 is a protein that controls cell growth, if your cancer is HER2 positive, it means it will more likely grow faster, spread, or come back.Â  Some cancer cells that are HER2-negative still have a number of HER2 proteins on the surface of the cells, these cancer cells are called HER2-low. Cancer medicines like Enhertu block HER2 receptors to reduce the ability of the cancer to grow and spread. Common EnhertuÂ side effectsÂ may include: Serious Enhertu side effects Get emergency medical help if you have signs of an allergic reaction: hives; difficulty breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.

Description: Entyvio ( vedolizumab ) is used for ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease to help improve symptoms, induce remission, and may also reduce the need for steroid medicines to control symptoms long-term. Entyvio is a selective immunosuppressant that works to control inflammation and symptoms of ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease by preventing too many white blood cells from entering your GI tract (intestine). Entyvio works selectively in the gut to decrease inflammation and does not usually lead to system-wide immunosuppression. Entyvio infusion is used for ulcerative colitis or Crohnâ€™s disease. Entyvio Pen or prefilled syringe is used for the maintenance treatment of UC and is given as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection). Entyvio infusion became an FDA-approved medicine on May 20, 2014. its indications are moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease in adults.

Biosimilars are near-identical copies of the first brand of infliximab (Remicade) and just as safe and effective with similar dosing regimens. Although there are no clinically meaningful differences, they are usually significantly less expensive. There are four FDA-approved biosimilars of infliximab but only three are available on the U.S. market: Infliximab works by binding specifically to a protein called TNF-Î± (tumor necrosis factor-alpha), which is released by white blood cells as part of our bodyâ€™s immune response to infection or invasion by foreign substances. Overproduction of TNF-Î± can cause inflammation, which can damage tissues, bones, and cartilage, and also cell death. When infliximab binds to TNF-Î±, it blocks its effects, and this reduces inflammation. Increased levels of TNF-alfa have been found in conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and ankylosing spondylitis. Infliximab is called a monoclonal antibody because the definition of monoclonal antibodies is that they bind specifically to a protein â€“ in this case, infliximab binds specifically to TNF-Î±. Infliximab belongs to the class of medicines known as TNF alfa inhibitors or TNF blockers.

Drug class: SGLT-2 inhibitors
Description: Jardiance (empagliflozin) is an FDA-approved tablet used to help control blood sugar levels in type 2 diabetes and is also used to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems in adults with heart failure or cardiovascular disease with type 2 diabetes. Jardiance lowers blood glucose levels (HbA1c) by helping the kidney increase the amount of glucose passing into the urine. Jardiance should be used together with diet and exercise when prescribed for type 2 diabetes. Jardiance 10mg tablets are also used for chronic kidney disease (CKD) in adults that have risk of disease prgression. In CKD Jardiance is used to reduce the risk of sustained decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), end-stage kidney disease, cardiovascular death and hospitalization. Jardiance is from the class of medicines called SGLT-2 inhibitors (sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors).Â  Jardiance works for type 2 diabetes by blocking SGLT-2 proteins located in the renal tubules of the kidneys, which are responsible for reabsorbing glucose back into the bloodstream. The way Jardiance works to reduce the risk of cardiovascular or heart failure is thought to be related to changes in heart muscle metabolism from favoring the use of glucose to using a more balanced combination of fatty acids, ketone bodies (ketone), branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) and glucose. Jardiance also improves the heart's diastolic stiffness and diastolic function. Type 2 diabetes is a long-term condition when your blood sugars (HbA1c) become too high because the body does not produce or use insulin normally.Â  Over time high blood sugar can cause serious health problems, including heart disease , vision loss , and kidney disease. By having better control of blood sugar levels helps reduce the risk of complications of diabetes. Jardiance is used for: Jardiance is not recommended:

Drug Name: Ketamine
Generic Name: Generic name: Ketamine
Brand name: Ketalar
Dosage form: Injection 200 mg/20 mL (10 mg/mL), 500 mg/10 mL (50 mg/mL), and 500 mg/5 mL (100 mg/mL)
Drug class: General anesthetics
Description: Ketamine is an anesthetic used to put you to sleep for surgery and to prevent pain and discomfort; Ketamine for depression and anxiety is currently being researched, using lower doses. Ketamine is also a drug of abuse that is used illegally recreationally for its hallucinogenic properties and is known to be a â€œdate rapeâ€ drug as it causes short-term memory loss. When used for anesthesia, ketamine is given as an intravenous injection (IV) or as an intramuscular injection (IM). Ketamine is an NMDA receptor antagonist. Esketamine ( Spravato ), one of the forms of racemic ketamine, was approved in 2019 for specific types of depression. Spravato is a nasal spray that is used under strict medical supervision and is not used by patients at home. Ketamine became an FDA-approved medicine on February 19, 1970, as a general anesthetic to be used as the sole anesthetic agent for diagnostic and surgical procedures that do not require skeletal muscle relaxation. It is also used for the induction of anesthesia prior to the administration of other general anesthetic agents and as a supplement to other anesthetic agents. Yes, In the U.S., ketamine is a controlled substance classified as a Schedule III drug under the DEA Controlled Substances Act .Â  This means that ketamine has a potential for abuse that is less than the drugs in schedules I and II. Abuse of the ketamine may lead to a moderate to low potential for physical dependence but high psychological dependence. Drugs that are classified as Schedule III are currently accepted for medical use in treatment in the U.S. Ketamine is abused illegally due to its dissociative properties. Dissociative drugs can lead to distortion of sights, colors, sounds, self, and one's environment. It is often "snorted" up the nose, injected, mixed into drinks, or smoked with marijuana or tobacco. Other dissociative drugs include phencyclidine (PCP), Salvia divinorum, and dextromethorphan (DXM). Hallucinogens include LSD, psilocybin, and mescaline. Abuse of large doses of this medicine can also lead to powerful visual hallucinations that are intensified by environmental stimuli. Coma and deep unconsciousness can occur. When higher doses of ketamine are abused or during emergence, it is reported to produce vivid dreams and an â€œout-of-bodyâ€, â€œK-holeâ€ or â€œnear-deathâ€ hallucinogenic experience, often reported as terrifying (similar to a bad LSD trip). Abuse of ketamine can be linked with short-term and long-term problems: There is also the risk of HIV, hepatitis, and other infectious diseases from shared needles. Ketamine use can be fatal in people who are alcoholics or acutely intoxicated with alcohol. There are animal reports of an increased risk of toxicity when ketamine is combined with caffeine. Theoretically, this may be a concern in people who have consumed energy drinks, often done at nightclubs where this medicine may be abused. The intensity of side effects is related to the dose of the drug consumed. Common ketamine side effects, when used medically,Â include confusion or a dream-like feeling. Serious ketamine side effects , when used medically, include: Allergic reactions - get emergency medical help if you have signs of an allergic reaction, including hives, difficulty breathing, and swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat. Tell your caregivers if you have hallucinations or unusual thoughts while waking up from anesthesia . Call your doctor at once if you have: This is not a complete list of side effects, and others may occur. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088. Ketamine side effects (more detail) Ketamine should not be used in patients for whom a significant elevation of blood pressure would constitute a serious hazard or in patients with known hypersensitivity to ketamine or to any excipient.

Drug Name: Keytruda
Generic Name: Pronunciation: key-true-duh
Generic name: pembrolizumab
Dosage form: intravenous solution
Drug class: Anti-PD-1 and PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies (immune checkpoint inhibitors)
Description: Keytruda (pembrolizumab) is a type of immunotherapy that is given by intravenous (into a vein) infusion over 30 minutes to treat many different types of cancer such as melanoma, lung cancer, and some lymphomas (see below for the full list of cancers Keytruda is approved for). It may be used alone or in combination with other medicines, including chemotherapy. Keytruda works by binding to and blocking the interaction of the PD-1 (programmed death receptor-1) receptor with other proteins including PD-L1 and PD-L2. An upregulation of the PD-1 receptors occurs in some cancers and signaling through this pathway prevents the T-cells in our immune system from finding and attacking cancer cells. Animal studies have found that blocking PD-1 receptors helps the immune system to slow or stop the growth and spread of cancer cells in the body. Keytruda belongs to the class of monoclonal antibodies called PD-1 blocking antibodies. Keytruda may be used to treat: Keytruda is only approved for certain types of cancer and may require a specific treatment history. In some cases, the tumor may need to be tested for particular genetic markers like PD-L1, dMMR, TMB, or pMMR to determine if Keytruda is right for you. Click here for more in-depth information on approved uses: Keytruda prescribing Information . Keytruda is often given when the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, or cannot be treated with surgery or radiation, or when other cancer treatments did not work or have stopped working.

Drug Name: Krill Oil
Generic Name: Generic name: omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids
Brand names: Mercola Krill Oil, Schiff MegaRed Omega-3 Krill Oil, Neptune Krill Oil, Red Whale Krill Oil
Description: Krill is a small crustacean with an appearance similar to shrimp. They are found in the colder waters of the ocean. Krill primarily serve as a food source for other animals in the ocean, for example - whales, seals, penguins, squid and fish. Krill is found in the oceans off of Antarctica, Canada, and Japan. Harvesting of krill is controversial. There is concern that commercial harvesting of Krill for use in Krill Oil supplements could threaten the species that consume it for food, including whales. All krill oil sold in nutritional supplements is harvested out of the open ocean, upsetting the natural balance of food supplies for larger marine animals. Commercial uses of Krill include salmon aquaculture farming, harvesting for use in Krill Oil capsules, as food for home aquariums, and as a human food source. Krill, known as Okiami has been harvested by the Japanese as a human food source since the 19th century, and is also consumed in South Korea and Taiwan. Krill has a pink or red appearance due to the plankton that they consume as a food source in the ocean. 1 Krill contains an oil that is similar to the oils found in fish oils, the omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids are recommended for use in lowering triglyceride levels. Krill Oil use as a supplement to lower blood lipids is increasing in popularity. 1 Krill Oil contains: Unlike fish oil, the omega-3 fatty acids in Krill oil are absorbed and carried to the body's cells in phospholipid form. Omega-3 fatty acids, in combination with diet and exercise, work by lowering the body's production of â€œbadâ€, low density lipoprotein (LDL) and triglycerides, and may raise high density lipoprotein (HDL) â€œgoodâ€ Â cholesterol. High levels of cholesterol and triglycerides can lead to coronary artery disease, heart disease, and stroke. Supportive, but not conclusive research shows that consumption of EPA and DHA omega-3 fatty acids may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease. Krill Oil also contains: Krill Oil has also been used to treat high blood pressure , stroke , cancer , osteoarthritis , depression and premenstrual syndrome (PMS), although high quality studies with adequately sized populations validating these uses are lacking. Patients should speak with their physician prior to using Krill Oil for any condition. Warnings issued by the FDA note that certain fish (marlin, tuna, swordfish) may contain toxins such as methylmercury, leading some consumers to be wary of eating fish to obtain omega-3 fatty acids. Manufacturers of Krill Oil suggest it may be safer due to lower levels of contaminants such as mercury. The FDA has issued recommendations that women who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant, and young children avoid eating more than 6 ounces of fish per week. However, Krill may also contain methylmercury and other pollutants from sea water, although they are lower on the food chain and may contain lower values of such pollutants. One study noted that Krill harvested from Antarctica contains high levels of organic pesticides. 3 Manufacturers of Krill Oil claim one of the advantages of Krill Oil over Fish Oil is that it does not lead to the fishy aftertaste, reflux or belching of fish flavors, a common side effect with fish oil supplements . However, Krill Oil may still lead to these side effects in some patients. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not specifically made recommendations on Krill Oil safety or effectiveness. Krill Oil is considered a dietary supplement and does not require a prescription. 1,4,5,6,7,8 Krill Oil may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.

Drug Name: Kyleena
Generic Name: Generic name: levonorgestrel intrauterine system [Â LEE-voe-nor-JES-trel-IN-tra-UE-ter-ine-SIS-temÂ ]
Drug classes: Contraceptives, Progestins
Description: Kyleena contains levonorgestrel , a female hormone that can cause changes in your cervical mucus and uterine lining, making it harder for sperm to reach the uterus and harder for a fertilized egg to attach to the uterus. The Kyleena levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system is a small, flexible plastic T-shaped device containing 19.5 mg levonorgestrel. The Kyleena intrauterine device (IUD) is placed in the uterus where it slowly releases the hormone. Because the IUD releases levonorgestrel into your uterus, only small amounts of the hormone enter your blood. Kyleena does not contain estrogen and should not be used as emergency birth control. The Kyleena IUD is placed in your uterus by your healthcare provider to prevent pregnancy for up to 5 years. The IUD can be removed by your healthcare provider at any time. Kleena can be used whether or not you have given birth to a child. Two thin threads are attached to the stem (lower end) of Kyleena. The threads are the only part of Kyleena you can feel when the IUD is in your uterus; however, unlike a tampon string, the threads do not extend outside your body.

Drug class: Statins
Description: Lipitor is used together with diet, weight loss, and exercise to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke and to decrease the chance that heart surgery will be needed in people who have heart disease or who are at risk of developing heart disease. Lipitor is also used to lower the amount of fatty substances such as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol ('bad cholesterol') and triglycerides in the blood and to increase the amount of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ('good cholesterol') in the blood. Lipitor may also be used to decrease the amount of cholesterol and other fatty substances in the blood in children and teenagers 10 to 17 years of age who have familial heterozygous hypercholesterolemia (an inherited condition in which cholesterol cannot be removed from the body normally). Lipitor (atorvastatin) belongs to a class of medications called HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins). It works by slowing the production of cholesterol in the body to decrease the amount of cholesterol that may build up on the walls of the arteries and block blood flow to the heart, brain, and other parts of the body. Accumulation of cholesterol and fats along the walls of your arteries (a process known as atherosclerosis) decreases blood flow and, therefore, the oxygen supply to your heart, brain, and other parts of your body. Lowering your blood level of cholesterol and fats with Lipitor has been shown to prevent heart disease, angina (chest pain), strokes, and heart attacks.

Drug class: Opioids (narcotic analgesics)
Description: Morphine is used to treat moderate to severe pain when alternative pain relief medicines are not effective or not tolerated. Morphine is an opioid pain-relieving medication that usually provides significant pain relief for short-term or chronic pain. Morphine belongs to a class of medications called opiate (narcotic) analgesics . Morphine works by changing the way the brain and nervous system respond to pain; it does this by binding to the mu-opioid receptors within the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Morphine is available as oral liquid, tablets, extended-release tablets and capsules, intravenous (IV), suppositories, and epidural. Morphine may also be abused and may be considered contraindicated in patients with a history of substance abuse or abusing opioids. Morphine is a Schedule 2 controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA).Â  This means that morphine has a high potential for abuse but has a currently accepted medical use as a treatment or a currently accepted medical use with severe restrictions. Abuse may lead to severe psychological or physical dependence. Common morphine side effects include drowsiness, dizziness, tiredness, anxiety , nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, gas, or constipation , sweating, low oxygen levels ( shortness of breath ), feeling light-headed or feelings of extreme happiness or sadness. Get emergency medical help if you have signs of an allergic reaction to morphine: hives, difficult breathing, swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat. Opioid medicine can slow or stop your breathing, and death may occur, especially if you drink alcohol or use other drugs that cause drowsiness or slow breathing. A person caring for you should give naloxone and/or seek emergency medical attention if you have slow breathing with long pauses, blue colored lips, or if you are hard to wake up. Morphine may cause other serious side effects. Call your doctor at once if you have: Serious breathing problems may be more likely in older adults and people who are debilitated or have wasting syndrome or chronic breathing disorders. Seek medical attention right away if you have symptoms of serotonin syndrome, such as: agitation , hallucinations, fever , sweating , shivering, fast heart rate , muscle stiffness, twitching, loss of coordination, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea . This is not a complete list of side effects and others may occur. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.

This lowers LDL-C levels in the blood. The ezetimibe component reduces blood cholesterol by inhibiting the absorption of dietary cholesterol by the sterol transporter, Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1), which is located in the small intestine. Nexlizet was first FDA-approved on February 26, 2020. Warnings The ezetimibe ingredient in Nexlizet may cause hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, or urticaria.

Drug Name: Nexplanon
Generic Name: Generic name: etonogestrel (implant) [Â e-toe-noe-JES-trelÂ ]
Drug classes: Contraceptives, Progestins
Description: Nexplanon (etonogestrel implant) is a long-term, reversible birth control for women. It is a contraceptive implant that is a flexible, thin plastic rod that is about the length of a matchstick (4cm by 2mm), which is placed under the skin on the inner side of the upper arm by your doctor or other healthcare provider. Once you have it placed in your arm you donâ€™t need to think about contraception for the next three years, you donâ€™t need to worry about forgetting to take it, whether you have used it correctly and there is no need to interrupt sex to organise contraception. Nexplanon can be removed at any time and your fertility will return to normal. The rod contains a hormone called etonogestrel that slowly and steadily releases to prevent pregnancy. It does this by stopping the release of an egg from your ovary, thinning the lining of your uterus and thickening mucus in your cervix. The implant is made of a material that can be seen on X-rays and sometimes your health provider may use an X-ray to help locate it for removal. Nexplanon is inserted through a needle (under local anesthesia) into the skin of your upper arm, just inside and above the elbow. After the implant is inserted, your arm will be covered with 2 bandages. Remove the top bandage after 24 hours, but leave the smaller bandage on for 3 to 5 days. Keep the area clean and dry. The timing of when you receive the Nexplanon implant depends on whether you were using birth control before, and what type it was. For more information about how quickly it works as a contraceptive see dosing information below. You should be able to feel the implant under your skin. Tell your doctor if you cannot feel the implant at any time while it is in place. The Nexplanon implant can remain in place for up to 3 years. If the implant is placed correctly, you will not need to use back-up birth control. Follow your doctor's instructions. You may have irregular and unpredictable periods while using Nexplanon. Tell your doctor if your periods are very heavy or long-lasting, or if you miss a period (you may be pregnant). If you need major surgery or will be on long-term bed rest, or if you need medical tests, may need to have your Nexplanon implant removed for a short time. Any doctor or surgeon who treats you should know that you have a Nexplanon implant. Have regular physical exams and mammograms, and self-examine your breasts for lumps on a monthly basis while using this medicine. Call your doctor at once if it feels like the Nexplanon implant may be bent or broken while it is in your arm. To remove the device, your health care provider will inject a local anesthetic in your arm beneath the implant. They will make a small incision in your skin and will push the implant toward the incision until the tip is visible and can be grasped with forceps. Your health care provider will then pull out the implant, close the incision and apply a pressure bandage. Contraceptive implant removal typically takes less than five minutes. If you choose, a new device can be implanted as soon as the original device is removed. Be prepared to use another type of contraception right away if you don't have a new device inserted. For information on â€˜Problems with Insertion and Removalâ€™ see the section below called â€˜What are the possible risks of using Nexplanon?â€™ If your Nexplanon implant is inserted correctly, it is one of the most effective types of birth control. Your chance of getting pregnant is very low, less than 1 pregnancy per 100 women. This medicine may be less effective in overweight women. Yes, you can become pregnant using Nexplanon, but it is very rare. If you do become pregnant it is important to see your healthcare provider to make sure it is not an ectopic pregnancy, which is when the pregnancy is outside of the womb. Women on Nexplanon have a slightly higher risk of ectopic pregnancy compared to women not using birth control. It is important to have the implant removed if you become pregnant and plan on maintaining the pregnancy. This medicine is not likely to cause birth defects if you become pregnant while using it. Nexplanon lasts for 3 years and at the end of the 3 years your implant must be removed. If you still require contraception a new implant may be inserted at the time of removal. You can have Nexplanon removed at any time and you will return to your normal fertility. Detailed Nexplanon dosage information How long before Nexplanon starts to working as a contraceptive depends on if you have previously been using no contraception, or another form of contraception or whether you have recently had a baby, miscarriage or abortion. No previous contraception Previous combination hormonal contraception (eg combined hormonal pills, vaginal ring or transdermal patch) Previous progestin-only contraceptives Previous miscarriage or abortion After giving birth Your fertility will return to normal after removal of Nexplanon, with women in studies becoming pregnant 7 to 14 days after removal. If you do not want to become pregnant then it is important to consider having another Nexplanon inserted at the same time as removal or starting another form of birth control. Nexplanon is an implant that lasts for 3 years. It is not intended for contraceptive use after 3 years and should be replaced with a new one if you want to continue having contraceptive cover. You should keep a record of when you had Nexplanon inserted and just before the end of the third year make an appointment for removal of the implant. You may have your Nexplanon replaced with a new one at the same appointment if you want to continue with contraception.

Drug Name: Tibsovo
Generic Name: Pronunciation: tib-SOH-voh
Generic name: ivosidenib
Dosage form: oral tablets
Drug class: Miscellaneous antineoplastics
Description: Tibsovo (ivosidenib) is a once-daily oral medication that targets a specific gene mutation called the isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1) mutation, which can affect your bone marrow. An IDH1 mutation prevents young blood cells from developing into healthy adult blood cells, which can result in blood and bone marrow disorders such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Tibsovo may be used to treat adults with a confirmed susceptible IDH1 mutation with: Tibsovo targets the IDH1 mutation. In regular cells, the IDH1 gene produces the IDH1 protein, involved in normal cellular chemical processes. However, when the IDH1 gene is modified due to a genetic mutation, it leads to an abnormal version of the IDH1 protein and other substances such as the oncometabolite, D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). Tibsovo decreases levels of 2-HG, reducing blast counts and increasing levels of mature myeloid cells. Blasts are undeveloped bone marrow cells that will later mature into red blood cells, white blood cells, or blood-clotting platelets. They are typically absent in the bloodstream, and their presence signals a bone marrow issue, such as myelodysplastic syndrome. Up to 20% of people with cholangiocarcinoma, and 6% to 10% of people with AML have the IDH1 mutation. Tibsovo was first FDA-approved on July 20, 2018.

Generic Name: Brand names: Mounjaro, Zepbound
Dosage form: Subcutaneous injection (2.5 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 12.5 mg,15 mg per 0.5 mL in single-dose pen)
Drug class: Incretin mimetics
Description: Tirzepatide is a prescription medicine used for weight loss (Zepbound brand) and type 2 diabetes (Mounjaro brand) in adults. Tirzepatide works for weight loss by decreasing appetite and slowing the movement of food from the stomach into the small intestine, which may make you feel full more quickly and for a longer period of time. In type 2 diabetes, tirzepatide decreases blood sugar levels by increasing insulin production and lowering the amount of sugar the liver makes. Tirzepatide is given as an injection under the skin once a week. Tirzepatide is a GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist. Zepbound is FDA-approved for weight loss for adults with obesity or who are overweight and have weight-related medical problems. Zepbound helps you to lose weight and maintain weight loss and should be combined with diet and exercise. Mounjaro is used to help lower blood sugar in adults with type 2 diabetes ; it should be used together with diet and exercise.

It may be used for: Wilate may also be used to treat adults and adolescents aged and older with hemophilia A for: Wilate works by temporarily replacing missing von Willebrand factor (VWF) and coagulation factor VIII (FVIII), in the blood to aid in clotting. VWF promotes platelet aggregation and platelet adhesion on damaged blood vessel walls. It also acts as a carrier protein for the procoagulant protein FVIII, an essential cofactor in the activation of factor X leading to the formation of thrombin and fibrin. Patients suffering from VWD have a deficiency or abnormality of VWF. This reduction in VWF plasma concentration results in correspondingly low FVIII activity and abnormal platelet function, thereby resulting in excessive bleeding. [9] After administration, WILATE temporarily When infused into a patient with hemophilia A, Wilate replaces missing FVIII which then binds to VWF in the patientÂ´s circulation. Activated FVIII (FVIIIa) acts as a cofactor for activated factor IX (FIXa), accelerating the conversion of factor X to activated factor X (FXa). FXa converts prothrombin into thrombin. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed. By increasing levels of FVIII, Wilate temporarily corrects the factor deficiency, resolving the bleeding tendency. Hemophilia A is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of antihemophilic factor VIII and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles, or internal organs, either spontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma. Wilate was first FDA-approved on December 7, 2009, for von Willebrandâ€™s disease. This approval was expanded to hemophilia A on October 8, 2018.

Yervoy is an immunotherapy that blocks a protein (antigen) that can stop your immune system from working properly and attacking cancer cells. When Yervoy has blocked the protein (CTLA-4) the immune system is able to find and kill the cancer cells. Yervoy is from the class of medicines called immune checkpoint inhibitors, and because it blocks the T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4), it is called a CTLA-4 inhibitor. Yervoy became an FDA-approved medicine on August 18, 2010, for treating advanced melanoma, and since then, the FDA approval has been extended to include a range of cancers. T-cells are white blood cells that are part of the immune system involved in finding and killing cancer cells. There is a protein called cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) on the surface of the T-cells that suppresses immune activity. Yervoy blocks the CTLA-4 antigen, activating the immune response to find and attack the cancer cells. Yervoy is FDA-approved to treat a range of specific cancers, including To be treated with Yervoy you must have a specific form of the cancer and meet the specific conditions. For more information see Prescribing Information. Yervoy is often given when the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, cannot be surgically removed, or has come back after prior treatment.

Drug Name: Zeposia
Generic Name: Generic name: ozanimod [ oh-ZAN-i-mod ]
Dosage form: oral capsule (0.23 mg; 0.46 mg; 0.92 mg)
Drug class: Selective immunosuppressants
Description: Zeposia ( ozanimod ) capsules are used to treat adults with types relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) and moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC). Zeposia helps to reduce the relapse rate and the number and size of brain lesions in multiple sclerosis. For ulcerative colitis, Zeposia is used to reduce symptoms, and it can also help achieve and maintain remission. Zeposia is FDA-approved to treat adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis and also FDA-approved to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis, including clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and active secondary progressive disease. Multiple sclerosis and ulcerative colitis are both autoimmune disorders where the immune cells (lymphocytes) are thought to incorrectly start attacking your healthy tissue, thinking that it is a foreign substance. In multiple sclerosis, the immune system attacks and damages the myelin sheath that covers the nerves in the brain and spinal cord (CNS). This disrupts the brain from sending signals to the rest of the body and causes symptoms including numbness and tingling in the face, arms, feet, and legs, balance issues and trouble walking, vision problems, bowel and bladder problems, fatigue, and problems thinking and concentrating. In ulcerative colitis, the immune system attacks and causes inflammation in the lining of the colon which causes the symptoms of abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, bowel urgency, diarrhea, and tiredness. Zeposia is thought to work by preventing immune cells (lymphocytes) from entering the intestines and central nervous system (CNS). It does this by trapping the immune cells in the lymph nodes, which may stop them from causing harmful inflammation in the CNS (in the case of multiple sclerosis) and the colon (in the case of ulcerative colitis). By reducing inflammation that would have been caused by the lymphocytes, the symptoms of these conditions may improve. Zepsosia is from a class of medicines called sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulators. Zeposia has its effect by binding to the S1P1 receptors on a range of cells which is thought to stop the lymphocytes from being able to leave the lymph nodes.
