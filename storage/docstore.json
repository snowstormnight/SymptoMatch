Pediatric patients (aged 2 years to 18 years) with COVID-19 still have access to Actrema under emergency use authorization (EUA). Actrema is a monoclonal antibody that blocks a protein in your body called interleukin-6 (IL-6). If this protein is activated, it causes your immune system to be overactive which results in inflammation and the signs and symptoms of autoimmune disease.As Actrema blocks the interleukin-6 receptor, this is how it is thought to reduce the immune system from being overactive, so there is less inflammation and a reduction in the signs and symptoms of autoimmune diseases. At a more technical level the mode of action (MOA) of Actrema is that it binds to IL-6 receptors (sIL-6R and mIL-6R) which have been shown to inhibit IL-6-mediated signaling through these receptors. Interleukin-6 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that is made by a variety of cell types including T- and B-cells, lymphocytes, monocytes and fibroblasts.

Atorvastatin calcium belongs to a class of medications called HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins). Atorvastatin calcium works by slowing the production of cholesterol in the body to decrease the amount of cholesterol that may build up on the walls of the arteries and block blood flow to the heart, brain, and other parts of the body. Atorvastatin is used together with diet, weight loss, and exercise to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke and to decrease the chance that heart surgery will be needed in people who have heart disease or who are at risk of developing heart disease. Atorvastatin is also used to lower the amount of fatty substances such as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol ('bad cholesterol') and triglycerides in the blood and to increase the amount of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ('good cholesterol') in the blood. Atorvastatin may also be used to decrease the amount of cholesterol and other fatty substances in the blood in children and teenagers 10 to 17 years of age who have familial heterozygous hypercholesterolemia (an inherited condition in which cholesterol cannot be removed from the body normally). Accumulation of cholesterol and fats along the walls of your arteries (a process known as atherosclerosis) decreases blood flow and, therefore, the oxygen supply to your heart, brain, and other parts of your body. Lowering your blood level of cholesterol and fats with atorvastatin has been shown to prevent heart disease, angina (chest pain), strokes, and heart attacks. Common atorvastatin side effects may include pain in your bones, spine, joints, or muscles, pain and burning when you urinate, painful urination, muscle spasms, upset stomach , trouble sleeping, stuffy nose, runny nose, sore throat, diarrhea , nausea , or pain in your arms or legs.

Deutetrabenazine is not a cure for Huntington's disease and will not treat other symptoms of this condition. Austedo is also used in adults to treat symptoms of tardive dyskinesia (TD), a nervous system disorder. Tardive dyskinesia causes repetitive uncontrolled muscle movements, usually in the face (chewing, lip smacking, frowning, tongue movement, blinking or eye movement). Austedo belongs to a class of medications called vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) inhibitors. It works by changing the activity of certain natural substances in the brain that affect nerves and muscles. Austedo is taken twice daily, and Austedo XR (extended-release tablet) is taken once daily. Body movement or motor function is controlled in the brain by nerve cells (neurons) that speak to each other by passing chemical messengers (neurotransmitters) from one nerve cell to another nerve cell. In movement disorders such as Huntingtons disease and tardive dyskinesia there can be a problem with this system and by lowering the amount of chemical messengers between the nerve cells you relieve the uncontrolled movements. A protein called VMAT2 controls how much chemical messenger is stored in the nerve cell and how much is released. The VMAT2 inhibitors block VMAT2 which means there is a lower amount of neurotransmitter available and therefore reduces the unwanted body movements.\r\n\r\nDrug Name: Auvelity\r\nGeneric Name: Pronunciation: aw-VEHL-ah-tee\r\nGeneric name: bupropion and dextromethorphan\r\nDosage form: extended-release tablets\r\nDrug class: Miscellaneous antidepressants\r\nDescription: Auvelity is an antidepressant medicine used to treat Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) which is a specific type of depression. Auvelity is a rapid-acting antidepressant that started working as early as 1 week, and patients' depression symptoms continued to improve over time when compared to placebo in a 6-week clinical study for MDD (Study 1, NCT04019704). Auvelity contains two active ingredients, bupropion and dextromethorphan . Auvelity is thought to work by increasing the amount of glutamate (a chemical messenger) available in your brain, which may positively affect your mood and ease depressive symptoms. It may also weakly affect your brain's other neurotransmitters, norepinephrine and dopamine. Auvelity became an FDA-approved medicine on August 18, 2022, for adults with major depressive disorder (MDD). Auvelitys active ingredient, dextromethorphan, belongs to a drug class called N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists (which means it blocks these receptors) and is also an agonist at the sigma-1 receptors (stimulates these receptors), these effects help improve depressive symptoms.", "start_char_idx": 50213, "end_char_idx": 54473, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "68c8755c-e95f-4d6f-963f-a4eaa34e4fd7": {"__data__": {"id_": "68c8755c-e95f-4d6f-963f-a4eaa34e4fd7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/snows/Desktop/test/drug_info.txt", "file_name": "drug_info.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 766763, "creation_date": "2024-03-31", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-31"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "97210ee2-d555-4d6b-ae33-e4385b58b061", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/snows/Desktop/test/drug_info.txt", "file_name": "drug_info.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 766763, "creation_date": "2024-03-31", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-31"}, "hash": "493e2543f25069f3d0b8bc9bfa3676e74e36c4644acd719e4e83895d2836ba4e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "db95db87-804d-4653-a209-c104e715bcf2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/snows/Desktop/test/drug_info.txt", "file_name": "drug_info.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 766763, "creation_date": "2024-03-31", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-31"}, "hash": "0aec5525b670d1fb926eb0007f215cb602f6c379fdf8e18242048c16ba065a1d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0004b2c6-414d-4955-a103-205f6364573b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c47679fae5cf0cfbc6556206c5f918f5af2f37d70618169185529cdfac38196a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Auvelity contains two active ingredients, bupropion and dextromethorphan .

Betamethasone topical (for the skin) is used to treat the inflammation and itching caused by a number of skin conditions such as eczema or psoriasis . Betamethasone topical is available in a cream, gel, ointment, lotion, foam, or spray. Topical betamethasone formulations are usually formulated with one of two salts: betamethasone dipropionate or betamethasone valerate. The potency of betamethasone formulations can vary depending on which salt is used  dipropionate or valerate. Betamethasone dipropionate contains two esters - this makes it more fat soluble and increases its ability to penetrate the skin better. This makes it more potent than betamethasone valerate, which only contains one ester. The absorption and potency of a topical steroid can also vary depending on the vehicle used to deliver the steroid (such as a cream, gel, lotion, or ointment) and if it has been augmented or not. Augmentation refers to enhancing the vehicle with a substance, such as propylene glycol, to allow it to penetrate the skin more quickly and work faster. For example, augmented betamethasone dipropionate 0.05% ointment or gel is a Class 1 (highly potent) topical steroid, but the augmented lotion or cream and regular betamethasone dipropionate ointment is Class 2.

Breyanzi side effects (more detail) Breyanzi is a suspension (liquid) injected intravenously (into a vein) by a doctor or nurse in a doctor's office or infusion center. It is usually given as two infusions over a total period of up to 30 minutes as a one-time dose. Before you receive this medicine your doctor or nurse will administer other chemotherapy medications to prepare your body for Breyanzi treatment. The Breyanzi procedure first starts with the collection of your white blood cells at a cell collection center using a procedure called leukapheresis (a process that removes white blood cells from the body). The white cells are sent away, where they are modified so that they are able to recognize and attack the cancer cells, this takes 3 or 4 weeks. These modified white cells are given to you as an infusion. Three days before your infusion, you will have chemotherapy to prepare your body for your treatment. Because this medication is made from your own cells, it must be given only to you. It is important to be on time and not miss your scheduled cell collection appointment(s) or to receive your treatment dose. You should plan to stay near where you received your Breyanzi treatment for at least 4 weeks after your dose. Your healthcare provider will check to see if your treatment is working and monitor you for any possible side effects. Talk to your doctor about how to prepare for leukapheresis and what to expect during and after the procedure.

It may also be given to treat adults with the following conditions under the accelerated approval scheme; continued approval may be contingent upon clinical trial results: Brukinsa directly inhibits an enzyme, called Brutons tyrosine kinase (BTK), by forming a covalent bond with a cysteine residue on the enzyme, preventing its activity. BTK works as a signaling molecule for the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) and cytokine receptor pathways. Activation of these pathways causes the proliferation of B cells and other interactions, and inhibition has been shown to reduce the growth and spread of malignant B cells. The ALPINE trial -- the first head-to-head phase 3 comparison trial of Brukinsa versus Imbruvica to be conducted -- reported Brukinsa was more effective than Imbruvica for progression-free survival in previously treated patients with relapsed or refractory CLL. Brukinsa also demonstrated a favorable cardiac safety profile with significantly lower rates of atrial fibrillation/flutter (5.2% vs. 13.3%) and no deaths due to cardiac disorders (vs 1.9% deaths with Imbruvica). Brukinsa was first approved in 2019 for MCL, and subsequent approvals for other indications followed.\r\n\r\nDrug Name: Bunavail\r\nGeneric Name: Generic name: buprenorphine and naloxone (oral/sublingual) [BUE-pre-NOR-feen-and-nal-OX-one]\r\nDrug class: Narcotic analgesic combinations\r\nDescription: Bunavail buccal films contains a combination of buprenorphine and naloxone.

Buprenorphine is used for opioid addiction to reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms without causing euphoria or dangerous side effects and helps prevent relapse. It works by being a substitute for the drug being abused, so the patient has minimal discomfort, which allows the patient to focus on their recovery. Buprenorphine for OUD is used as part of a complete treatment program that also includes counseling and behavioral therapy. For opioid use disorder, buprenorphine is available as long-acting injections ( Sublocade , Brixadi ) and sublingual tablets ( Subutex discontinued, generics available).

Carvykti is used in adults who have multiple myeloma that has returned, or that did not respond to at least 4 other treatments. Carvykti is an immunotherapy that is made from a patients own immune cells, which have been collected and genetically modified to be able to find and kill cancer cells. Carvykti is a B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-directed genetically modified autologous T cell immunotherapy. Carvykti is a Car-T therapy, which is a type of immunotherapy that is made using T cells from the patient's own blood. T-cells are part of the immune system that helps fight germs and protect you from disease, it does this by attaching to proteins (antigens) on the surface of cells that it needs to destroy. Multiple myeloma cancer cells have lots of B cell maturation antigens (BCMA) on the cancer cell surface. If your T cells don't have the right receptors, they can't attach to the antigens on the cancer to destroy them. In Carvykti therapy, the patient's collected T cells are changed by adding a gene for a receptor that attaches to the BCMA on the cancer cells so that it can attack and destroy them. The receptor gene that is added is called chimeric antigen receptor or CAR, so the T cells that have been modified are called CAR T cells. Carvykti became an FDA-approved medicine on February 28, 2022 It can be used to treat adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have already had four or more lines of therapy, including a proteasome inhibitor , an immunomodulatory agent, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody.

PNH is a rare acquired, life-threatening disease of the blood that is characterized by the destruction of red blood cells (hemolytic anemia), blood clots (thrombosis), and impaired bone marrow function. Empaveli works by binding to specific proteins in the complement system, which is a part of the immune system that enhances (or complements) the ability of antibodies and phagocytic cells to clear microbes and damaged cells from an organism, promote inflammation, and attack the pathogen's cell membrane. Empaveli binds to complement protein C3 and prevents it from splitting into C3a and C3b. This helps to stop intravascular hemolysis (IVH or the destruction of red blood cells in the circulation) and extravascular hemolysis (EVH or the breakdown of red blood cells in the spleen, bone marrow, or liver by macrophages). Empaveli is the only treatment that targets C3 and may prevent both forms of red blood cell destruction (IVH and EVH). It works higher in the complement system than other treatments used for PNH.

Entyvio is a selective immunosuppressant that works to control inflammation and symptoms of ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease by preventing too many white blood cells from entering your GI tract (intestine). Entyvio works selectively in the gut to decrease inflammation and does not usually lead to system-wide immunosuppression. Entyvio infusion is used for ulcerative colitis or Crohn\u2019s disease. Entyvio Pen or prefilled syringe is used for the maintenance treatment of UC and is given as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection). Entyvio infusion became an FDA-approved medicine on May 20, 2014. its indications are moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease in adults. Entyvio Pen (subcutaneous) became FDA approved on September 27,2023. No biosimilars of vedolizumab have been approved by the FDA. Entyvio belongs to the drug class called integrin receptor antagonists. Entyvio\u2019s mechanism of action (MOA), or how it works, is by binding to \u03b14\u03b27 integrin on the surface of a type of white blood cell called memory T-lymphocytes. Binding to \u03b14\u03b27 integrin blocks it from interacting with MAdCAM-1 (mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1). This interaction plays a key role in causing the chronic inflammation seen in people with IBD. The most common side effects of Entyvio include fever, sore throat, flu symptoms; cold symptoms such as stuffy nose, sinus pain, sneezing, cough with mucus, shortness of breath, chest discomfort, pain in your arms or legs, tiredness; headache, joint pain, back pain, rash, itching, or nausea.

Epclusa is a once-a-day medicine containing two antiviral medicines, sofosbuvir and velpatasvir . Epclusa helps stop the hepatitis C virus (HCV) from multiplying in the body by blocking a protein in the virus called HCV NS5. Hepatitis C is a viral disease that causes inflammation of the liver that can lead to a decrease in liver function or liver failure. HCV infection can become chronic (long-lasting) and, over many years, may cause complications, such as bleeding, jaundice (yellowish eyes or skin), fluid accumulation in the abdomen, infections, liver cancer, and death.\u00a0 When Eplusa was taken in chronic HCV patients with mild or no cirrhosis, results of studies showed that 95\u201399 percent of patients had no virus detected in the blood 12 weeks after finishing treatment. Epclusa received FDA approval on June 28, 2016, and is now approved to treat chronic hepatitis C genotypes (1 to 6) in adults and children 3 years of age and older without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis. Epclusa is sometimes given in combination with another antiviral medicine called ribavirin in people who also have decompensated cirrhosis with chronic hepatitis C. Common Epclusa side effects may include headache , tiredness, nausea , vomiting, sleep problems ( insomnia ), diarrhea , low red blood cells (anemia) in people with cirrhosis, pale skin, tiredness, feeling light-headed or short of breath, cold hands and feet.

Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid medicine that is up to 100 times stronger than other opioids like morphine , heroin,\u00a0or oxycodone . Fentanyl is from the class of medicines called narcotic analgesics. Fentanyl patches are used for long-lasting pain relief, and for fast-acting pain relief, fentanyl nasal sprays, lollipops, injections, sublingual tablets, and sprays are used. Fentanyl is a prescription medicine that is classified as Schedule 2 under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). Although fentanyl is a legal prescription drug used for pain control during surgery and for chronic or breakthrough pain, it is also being manufactured illegally, or legal prescriptions are diverted, and fentanyl is misused and abused as it is sold for its euphoric effects. Fentanyl overdose symptoms may include extreme drowsiness, weak pulse, fainting, and slow breathing (breathing may stop). Seek emergency medical attention immediately or call the Poison Help line at 1-800-222-1222. A fentanyl overdose can be fatal, especially in a child or other person using the medicine without a prescription. Naloxone ( Narcan nasal spray , Kloxxado nasal spray , Zimhi injection , Naloxone injection) is a safe and easily accessible medication used to reverse an opioid overdose and help restore breathing by blocking or reversing the opioid effects. If an overdose is due to fentanyl, then multiple bolus injections of naloxone or even continuous infusions may be needed to reverse the opioid action. Learn how to use naloxone before it is needed. When used as a prescribed medicine, common fentanyl side effects may include: Get emergency medical help if you have signs of an allergic reaction to fentanyl: hives, difficulty breathing, swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat. Like other narcotic medicines, fentanyl can slow your breathing. Death may occur if breathing becomes too weak. A person caring for you should seek emergency medical attention if you have slow breathing with long pauses, blue-colored lips, or if you are hard to wake up. Fentanyl may cause other serious side effects. Call your doctor at once if you have: Seek medical attention immediately if you have symptoms of serotonin syndrome, such as agitation , hallucinations, fever, sweating, shivering, fast heart rate , muscle stiffness, twitching, loss of coordination, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea . Serious side effects may be more likely in older adults and those who are malnourished or debilitated.

Fexofenadine is also used to treat skin itching and hives caused by a condition called chronic idiopathic urticaria in adults and children who are at least 6 years old. Fexofenadine works selectively on histamine-1 receptors that are located in our body, but not in our central nervous system - these are called peripheral histamine receptors. Because it acts on these receptors, fexofenadine is much less likely to cause drowsiness compared with some older antihistamines. Histamine is a chemical that is released by mast cells in response to an allergen, and it is responsible for many allergy symptoms, such as watery eyes, a runny nose, sneezing, and itching. Fexofenadine binds to histamine receptors and prevents histamine from having an effect on those receptors, which reduces allergy symptoms. There are many brands and forms of fexofenadine available. Fexofenadine was FDA approved in 1996.\r\n\r\nDrug Name: Fintepla\r\nGeneric Name: Pronunciation: fin-TEP-la\r\nGeneric name: fenfluramine\r\nDosage form: oral solution\r\nDrug classes: CNS stimulants, Miscellaneous anticonvulsants\r\nDescription: Fintepla is a prescription medicine used to treat the seizures associated with Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in patients 2 years of age and older.

The accelerated approval status for Imbruvica for Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) and Marginal Zone Lymphoma (MZL) was voluntarily withdrawn on April 6, 2023. This was because, although the Phase 3 SHINE study for MCL met its primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS), it was associated with an increased rate of adverse reactions. For MZL, the phase 3 SELENE study did not meet its primary endpoint of PFS. Imbruvica works by directly inhibiting an enzyme, called Bruton\u2019s tyrosine kinase (BTK). It forms a covalent bond with a cysteine residue on the enzyme, preventing its activity. BTK works as a signaling molecule for the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) and cytokine receptor pathways. Activation of these pathways causes the proliferation of B cells and other interactions, and inhibition has been shown to reduce the growth and spread of malignant B cells. It belongs to the class of medicines known as BTK inhibitors.

Biosimilars are near-identical copies of the first brand of infliximab (Remicade) and just as safe and effective with similar dosing regimens. Although there are no clinically meaningful differences, they are usually significantly less expensive. There are four FDA-approved biosimilars of infliximab but only three are available on the U.S. market: Infliximab works by binding specifically to a protein called TNF-\u03b1 (tumor necrosis factor-alpha), which is released by white blood cells as part of our body\u2019s immune response to infection or invasion by foreign substances. Overproduction of TNF-\u03b1 can cause inflammation, which can damage tissues, bones, and cartilage, and also cell death. When infliximab binds to TNF-\u03b1, it blocks its effects, and this reduces inflammation.

Ingrezza works by decreasing the amount of dopamine, in the nerve endings in the brain, which helps control body movements. Ingrezza is from a class of medicines called VMAT2 inhibitors , as it inhibits the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) in neurons. This medicine controls the symptoms of movement disorders but does not cure the conditions. Tardive dyskinesia is a nervous system disorder that causes repetitive, uncontrolled muscle movements, usually in the face (chewing, lip smacking, frowning, tongue movement, blinking, or eye movement). Tardive dyskinesia is often caused by long-term treatment with certain psychiatric medications. Chorea is a movement disorder that results in sudden involuntary movements. It can be caused by Huntington's disease (an inherited disease that causes the progressive breakdown of nerve cells in the brain). Ingrezza became an FDA-approved medicine on April 11, 2017, for adults with tardive dyskinesia, and on August 18, 2023, and it became approved for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington's disease. The chorea associated with Huntington's disease approval was based on positive results from the\u00a0 KINECT-HD Phase 3 study and the ongoing KINECT-HD2 that showed an improvement in chorea severity with a statistically significant greater improvement in Total Maximal Chorea (TMC) score when compared to placebo.

Ivermectin may also be used as an effective treatment for a wide range of other conditions and as a treatment of onchocerciasis, intestinal strongyloidiasis and onchocerciasis or river blindness. The antiviral activity of Ivermectin has been shown against a wide range of RNA and DNA viruses, for example, dengue, Zika, yellow fever, and others. Ivermectin is currently being investigated in a clinical trial as a potential COVID-19 treatment for the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 Virus, which is the virus that causes COVID-19. The FDA has not approved ivermectin for use in treating or preventing COVID-19 infection in humans. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommend not to use ivermectin in patients with COVID-19 to reduce viral replication, except in clinical trials. Experimental studies for ivermectin as an adjunct treatment for antiviral effects of hospitalized adult COVID-19 patients: a randomized multi-center clinical trial. There is currently insufficient evidence from the COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel to recommend either for or against the use of ivermectin in Covid-19 patients for the treatment of severe or mild COVID-19 symptoms. Click for further information on using ivermectin to treat COVID-19 and other prevention and investigational treatments and discuss with your health care provider. The CDC are reporting adverse effects associated with ivermectin misuse and overdose are increasing.

The way Jardiance works to reduce the risk of cardiovascular or heart failure is thought to be related to changes in heart muscle metabolism from favoring the use of glucose to using a more balanced combination of fatty acids, ketone bodies (ketone), branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) and glucose. Jardiance also improves the heart's diastolic stiffness and diastolic function. Type 2 diabetes is a long-term condition when your blood sugars (HbA1c) become too high because the body does not produce or use insulin normally.\u00a0 Over time high blood sugar can cause serious health problems, including heart disease , vision loss , and kidney disease.

Jatenzo is used only for men with low testosterone levels caused by certain medical conditions, including disorders of the testicles, pituitary gland, (a small gland in the brain), or hypothalamus (a part of the brain) that cause hypogonadism. Your doctor will order certain lab tests to check your testosterone levels to see if they are low before you begin to take this medicine. Jatenzo should not be used treat the symptoms of low testosterone in men who have low testosterone due to aging ('age-related hypogonadism'). Jatenzo is not intended for use by women. Testosterone is a hormone produced by the body that contributes to the growth, development, and functioning of the male sexual organs and typical male characteristics. Jatenzo works by replacing testosterone that is normally produced by the body. It is not known if testosterone is safe or effective in children younger than 18 years old. Improper use may affect bone growth in children. Jatenzo is a controlled substance because it contains testosterone that can be a target for people who abuse prescription medicines. Keep this medicine in a safe place to protect it. Never give your Jatenzo to anyone else, even if they have the same symptoms you have. Selling or giving away this medicine may harm others and is against the law.\r\n\r\nDrug Name: Jaypirca\r\nGeneric Name: Pronunciation: JAY-PIHR-KAA\r\nGeneric name: pirtobrutinib\r\nDosage form: Oral tablets\r\nDrug class: BTK inhibitors\r\nDescription: Jaypirca (pirtobrutinib) is an oral kinase inhibitor that is approved under the accelerated approval classification to treat adults with: Jaypirca works by blocking BTK which is a signaling protein found across numerous B-cell leukemia and lymphomas including MCL, CLL, and SLL, that when stimulated, activates pathways responsible for B-cell proliferation, activity, and growth.

It is a once a month injection given under the skin (subcutaneously) that you can self-administer in your own home. Kesimpta is from the group of medicines called CD20 monoclonal antibodies that targets B-cell antigens. Sometimes they are called B-cell therapy or B-cell depletion therapy. Kesimpta works by binding to and decreasing B-cells. This medicine will not cure MS, but is used to slow its progression and reduce relapse rate. MS is a chronic, ongoing disease that causes damage to the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves. This causes nerve signals to be interrupted and results in symptoms of numbness, tingling, mood changes, memory problems, pain, fatigue, blindness and/or paralysis. It is thought that B-cells play a critical role in MS which causes the immune system to attack nerves. Kesimpta works by binding to and decreasing the B-cells, which may slow your immune system attacking your nerves. This may decrease inflammation and reduce MS symptoms, slow your disability progression and lower relapse rate. Kesimpta is used in adults with specific types of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) including: Arzerra (ofatumumab) contains the same active ingredient to Kesimpta ( ofatumumab ) but they are NOT to be used interchangeably. They are used to treat different conditions and are given by a different route of administration .\r\n\r\nDrug Name: Ketamine\r\nGeneric Name: Generic name: Ketamine\r\nBrand name: Ketalar\r\nDosage form: Injection 200 mg/20 mL (10 mg/mL), 500 mg/10 mL (50 mg/mL), and 500 mg/5 mL (100 mg/mL)\r\nDrug class: General anesthetics\r\nDescription: Ketamine is an anesthetic used to put you to sleep for surgery and to prevent pain and discomfort; Ketamine for depression and anxiety is currently being researched, using lower doses.", "start_char_idx": 306205, "end_char_idx": 310271, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1fa0f99c-bb0e-4ec9-8539-d59008a0ce6b": {"__data__": {"id_": "1fa0f99c-bb0e-4ec9-8539-d59008a0ce6b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/snows/Desktop/test/drug_info.txt", "file_name": "drug_info.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 766763, "creation_date": "2024-03-31", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-31"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "97210ee2-d555-4d6b-ae33-e4385b58b061", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/snows/Desktop/test/drug_info.txt", "file_name": "drug_info.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 766763, "creation_date": "2024-03-31", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-31"}, "hash": "493e2543f25069f3d0b8bc9bfa3676e74e36c4644acd719e4e83895d2836ba4e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e22dda1e-4b70-4f9c-93cb-ee0c5ddd462c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/snows/Desktop/test/drug_info.txt", "file_name": "drug_info.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 766763, "creation_date": "2024-03-31", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-31"}, "hash": "32dd70762f1189622a7109da5e80114d2ffd7c8a44c78ac97d38f6f8e4937341", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f7562a30-c85d-4631-85c8-6cd72fc056e2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "39e8e7f19e591ca27ad426c8c203bdf1b1629d9a59b2f32a8e3daae627d9ff3d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Kesimpta is used in adults with specific types of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) including: Arzerra (ofatumumab) contains the same active ingredient to Kesimpta ( ofatumumab ) but they are NOT to be used interchangeably.

Ketamine is also a drug of abuse that is used illegally recreationally for its hallucinogenic properties and is known to be a \u201cdate rape\u201d drug as it causes short-term memory loss. When used for anesthesia, ketamine is given as an intravenous injection (IV) or as an intramuscular injection (IM). Ketamine is an NMDA receptor antagonist. Esketamine ( Spravato ), one of the forms of racemic ketamine, was approved in 2019 for specific types of depression. Spravato is a nasal spray that is used under strict medical supervision and is not used by patients at home. Ketamine became an FDA-approved medicine on February 19, 1970, as a general anesthetic to be used as the sole anesthetic agent for diagnostic and surgical procedures that do not require skeletal muscle relaxation. It is also used for the induction of anesthesia prior to the administration of other general anesthetic agents and as a supplement to other anesthetic agents. Yes, In the U.S., ketamine is a controlled substance classified as a Schedule III drug under the DEA Controlled Substances Act .\u00a0 This means that ketamine has a potential for abuse that is less than the drugs in schedules I and II. Abuse of the ketamine may lead to a moderate to low potential for physical dependence but high psychological dependence. Drugs that are classified as Schedule III are currently accepted for medical use in treatment in the U.S. Ketamine is abused illegally due to its dissociative properties. Dissociative drugs can lead to distortion of sights, colors, sounds, self, and one's environment. It is often \"snorted\" up the nose, injected, mixed into drinks, or smoked with marijuana or tobacco. Other dissociative drugs include phencyclidine (PCP), Salvia divinorum, and dextromethorphan (DXM). Hallucinogens include LSD, psilocybin, and mescaline. Abuse of large doses of this medicine can also lead to powerful visual hallucinations that are intensified by environmental stimuli. Coma and deep unconsciousness can occur. When higher doses of ketamine are abused or during emergence, it is reported to produce vivid dreams and an \u201cout-of-body\u201d, \u201cK-hole\u201d or \u201cnear-death\u201d hallucinogenic experience, often reported as terrifying (similar to a bad LSD trip). Abuse of ketamine can be linked with short-term and long-term problems: There is also the risk of HIV, hepatitis, and other infectious diseases from shared needles. Ketamine use can be fatal in people who are alcoholics or acutely intoxicated with alcohol. There are animal reports of an increased risk of toxicity when ketamine is combined with caffeine. Theoretically, this may be a concern in people who have consumed energy drinks, often done at nightclubs where this medicine may be abused. The intensity of side effects is related to the dose of the drug consumed. Common ketamine side effects, when used medically,\u00a0include confusion or a dream-like feeling. Serious ketamine side effects , when used medically, include: Allergic reactions - get emergency medical help if you have signs of an allergic reaction, including hives, difficulty breathing, and swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat. Tell your caregivers if you have hallucinations or unusual thoughts while waking up from anesthesia .

It may be used alone or in combination with other medicines, including chemotherapy. Keytruda works by binding to and blocking the interaction of the PD-1 (programmed death receptor-1) receptor with other proteins including PD-L1 and PD-L2. An upregulation of the PD-1 receptors occurs in some cancers and signaling through this pathway prevents the T-cells in our immune system from finding and attacking cancer cells. Animal studies have found that blocking PD-1 receptors helps the immune system to slow or stop the growth and spread of cancer cells in the body. Keytruda belongs to the class of monoclonal antibodies called PD-1 blocking antibodies. Keytruda may be used to treat: Keytruda is only approved for certain types of cancer and may require a specific treatment history. In some cases, the tumor may need to be tested for particular genetic markers like PD-L1, dMMR, TMB, or pMMR to determine if Keytruda is right for you.

They are found in the colder waters of the ocean. Krill primarily serve as a food source for other animals in the ocean, for example - whales, seals, penguins, squid and fish. Krill is found in the oceans off of Antarctica, Canada, and Japan. Harvesting of krill is controversial. There is concern that commercial harvesting of Krill for use in Krill Oil supplements could threaten the species that consume it for food, including whales. All krill oil sold in nutritional supplements is harvested out of the open ocean, upsetting the natural balance of food supplies for larger marine animals. Commercial uses of Krill include salmon aquaculture farming, harvesting for use in Krill Oil capsules, as food for home aquariums, and as a human food source. Krill, known as Okiami has been harvested by the Japanese as a human food source since the 19th century, and is also consumed in South Korea and Taiwan. Krill has a pink or red appearance due to the plankton that they consume as a food source in the ocean. 1 Krill contains an oil that is similar to the oils found in fish oils, the omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids are recommended for use in lowering triglyceride levels. Krill Oil use as a supplement to lower blood lipids is increasing in popularity. 1 Krill Oil contains: Unlike fish oil, the omega-3 fatty acids in Krill oil are absorbed and carried to the body's cells in phospholipid form. Omega-3 fatty acids, in combination with diet and exercise, work by lowering the body's production of \u201cbad\u201d, low density lipoprotein (LDL) and triglycerides, and may raise high density lipoprotein (HDL) \u201cgood\u201d \u00a0cholesterol. High levels of cholesterol and triglycerides can lead to coronary artery disease, heart disease, and stroke. Supportive, but not conclusive research shows that consumption of EPA and DHA omega-3 fatty acids may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease. Krill Oil also contains: Krill Oil has also been used to treat high blood pressure , stroke , cancer , osteoarthritis , depression and premenstrual syndrome (PMS), although high quality studies with adequately sized populations validating these uses are lacking. Patients should speak with their physician prior to using Krill Oil for any condition. Warnings issued by the FDA note that certain fish (marlin, tuna, swordfish) may contain toxins such as methylmercury, leading some consumers to be wary of eating fish to obtain omega-3 fatty acids. Manufacturers of Krill Oil suggest it may be safer due to lower levels of contaminants such as mercury. The FDA has issued recommendations that women who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant, and young children avoid eating more than 6 ounces of fish per week. However, Krill may also contain methylmercury and other pollutants from sea water, although they are lower on the food chain and may contain lower values of such pollutants. One study noted that Krill harvested from Antarctica contains high levels of organic pesticides.", "start_char_idx": 319279, "end_char_idx": 323756, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a54d083b-008c-4b90-98f2-af95cb4497d6": {"__data__": {"id_": "a54d083b-008c-4b90-98f2-af95cb4497d6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/snows/Desktop/test/drug_info.txt", "file_name": "drug_info.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 766763, "creation_date": "2024-03-31", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-31"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "97210ee2-d555-4d6b-ae33-e4385b58b061", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/snows/Desktop/test/drug_info.txt", "file_name": "drug_info.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 766763, "creation_date": "2024-03-31", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-31"}, "hash": "493e2543f25069f3d0b8bc9bfa3676e74e36c4644acd719e4e83895d2836ba4e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "bc59b8f9-e631-45c7-8356-ebdc7f1e3ddf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/snows/Desktop/test/drug_info.txt", "file_name": "drug_info.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 766763, "creation_date": "2024-03-31", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-31"}, "hash": "bab5820722acfc6e00c4edca6029ac0223687686851b14f2fd75cad4d5b188a7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9fd1b445-7b31-4ae0-ac04-096a1ce2e4c2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "99167c533c609bb718caa659e6e321bac4445e47f73bdc763b8cf110a4d643d9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Patients should speak with their physician prior to using Krill Oil for any condition.

The Kyleena levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system is a small, flexible plastic T-shaped device containing 19.5 mg levonorgestrel. The Kyleena intrauterine device (IUD) is placed in the uterus where it slowly releases the hormone. Because the IUD releases levonorgestrel into your uterus, only small amounts of the hormone enter your blood. Kyleena does not contain estrogen and should not be used as emergency birth control. The Kyleena IUD is placed in your uterus by your healthcare provider to prevent pregnancy for up to 5 years. The IUD can be removed by your healthcare provider at any time. Kleena can be used whether or not you have given birth to a child. Two thin threads are attached to the stem (lower end) of Kyleena. The threads are the only part of Kyleena you can feel when the IUD is in your uterus; however, unlike a tampon string, the threads do not extend outside your body.\r\n\r\nDrug Name: Kynmobi\r\nGeneric Name: Generic name: \u00a0apomorphine hydrochloride\r\nDosage form: sublingual film\r\nDrug class: Dopaminergic antiparkinsonism agents\r\nDescription: Warnings section not found\r\n\r\nDrug Name: Kyprolis\r\nGeneric Name: Generic name: carfilzomib [\u00a0kar-FILZ-oh-mib\u00a0]\r\nDosage form: Infusion\r\nDrug class: Proteasome inhibitors\r\nDescription: Kyprolis ( carfilzomib ) is a treatment for types of multiple myeloma when other medicines have not worked or have stopped working.

Leuprolide injection (Lupron Depot-PED, Fensolvi) is used in children 2 years of age or older to treat central precocious puberty (CPP; a condition causing girls [usually younger than 8 years of age] and boys [usually younger than 9 years of age] to enter puberty too soon, resulting in faster than normal bone growth and development of sexual characteristics). Leuprolide injection (Lupron Depot) is used alone or with another medication (norethindrone) to treat endometriosis (a condition in which the type of tissue that lines the uterus [womb] grows in other areas of the body and causes pain, heavy or irregular menstruation [periods], and other symptoms). Leuprolide injection (Lupron Depot) is also used with other medication to treat anemia (a lower than normal number of red blood cells) caused by uterine fibroids (noncancerous growths in the uterus). Leuprolide belongs to a class of medications called gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists. It works by decreasing the amount of certain hormones in the body. Get emergency medical help if you have signs of an allergic reaction to leuprolide (hives, difficult breathing, swelling in your face or throat) or a severe skin reaction ( fever , sore throat , burning eyes, skin pain, red or purple skin rash with blistering and peeling). Call your doctor at once if you have a seizure, unusual changes in mood or behavior (crying spells, irritability, restlessness, anger, aggression), severe headaches, ringing in your ears, dizziness, nausea , vision problems, or pain behind your eyes.

Lipitor is also used to lower the amount of fatty substances such as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol ('bad cholesterol') and triglycerides in the blood and to increase the amount of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ('good cholesterol') in the blood. Lipitor may also be used to decrease the amount of cholesterol and other fatty substances in the blood in children and teenagers 10 to 17 years of age who have familial heterozygous hypercholesterolemia (an inherited condition in which cholesterol cannot be removed from the body normally). Lipitor (atorvastatin) belongs to a class of medications called HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins). It works by slowing the production of cholesterol in the body to decrease the amount of cholesterol that may build up on the walls of the arteries and block blood flow to the heart, brain, and other parts of the body. Accumulation of cholesterol and fats along the walls of your arteries (a process known as atherosclerosis) decreases blood flow and, therefore, the oxygen supply to your heart, brain, and other parts of your body. Lowering your blood level of cholesterol and fats with Lipitor has been shown to prevent heart disease, angina (chest pain), strokes, and heart attacks.\r\n\r\nDrug Name: Lisinopril\r\nGeneric Name: Generic name: lisinopril [\u00a0lyse-IN-oh-pril\u00a0]\r\nBrand names: Prinivil, Qbrelis, Zestril\r\nDosage forms: oral solution (1 mg/mL), oral tablet (10 mg; 2.5 mg; 20 mg; 30 mg; 40 mg; 5 mg)\r\nDrug class: Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors\r\nDescription: Lisinopril is used alone or in combination with other medications to treat high blood pressure in adults and children 6 years of age and older.

Lupron Depot may used in men to treat prostate cancer, and some forms may be used to treat female hormone-related problems such as endometriosis and uterine fibroids. Lupron Depot-Ped may be used to treat precocious (early-onset) puberty in both male and female children at least 2 years old. Lupron injection 14-day kit may be used to delay the release of eggs that will be retrieved for in vitro fertilization (IVF).

Lupron Depot-GYN and many other branded leuprolide products are no longer available commercially in the U.S., but generic options are available through several manufacturers. Initially, leuprolide works by stimulating gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptors, which, at the beginning causes a surge in FSH and LH because GnRH controls the secretion of these hormones. However chronic administration causes a downregulation of these receptors, reducing the release of FSH and LH, and subsequent suppression of ovarian and testicular production of estradiol and testosterone respectively. It belongs to the class of medicines known as gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRH agonists).

Should be used in addition to dietary changes. The bempedoic acid component helps to reduce the risk of a heart attack or the need to undergo cardiac procedures to restore blood flow (coronary revascularization) in adults with established cardiovascular disease (CVD), or, without CVD but at high risk for a CVD event, who are unable to take (or do not take) recommended statin therapy. Nexlizet works by blocking an enzyme called adenosine triphosphate-citrate lyase (ACL) that is involved in the production of cholesterol by the liver (bempedoic acid component). This lowers LDL-C levels in the blood. The ezetimibe component reduces blood cholesterol by inhibiting the absorption of dietary cholesterol by the sterol transporter, Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1), which is located in the small intestine. Nexlizet was first FDA-approved on February 26, 2020. Warnings The ezetimibe ingredient in Nexlizet may cause hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, or urticaria. Do not use in people with a known hypersensitivity to ezetimibe. Stop taking Nexlizet and call your healthcare provider, or go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away if you have any signs or symptoms of an allergic reaction including: swelling of your face, lips, mouth, or tongue wheezing severe itching a fast heartbeat or pounding in your chest trouble breathing dizziness or fainting.

It is a contraceptive implant that is a flexible, thin plastic rod that is about the length of a matchstick (4cm by 2mm), which is placed under the skin on the inner side of the upper arm by your doctor or other healthcare provider. Once you have it placed in your arm you don\u2019t need to think about contraception for the next three years, you don\u2019t need to worry about forgetting to take it, whether you have used it correctly and there is no need to interrupt sex to organise contraception. Nexplanon can be removed at any time and your fertility will return to normal. The rod contains a hormone called etonogestrel that slowly and steadily releases to prevent pregnancy. It does this by stopping the release of an egg from your ovary, thinning the lining of your uterus and thickening mucus in your cervix. The implant is made of a material that can be seen on X-rays and sometimes your health provider may use an X-ray to help locate it for removal. Nexplanon is inserted through a needle (under local anesthesia) into the skin of your upper arm, just inside and above the elbow. After the implant is inserted, your arm will be covered with 2 bandages. Remove the top bandage after 24 hours, but leave the smaller bandage on for 3 to 5 days. Keep the area clean and dry. The timing of when you receive the Nexplanon implant depends on whether you were using birth control before, and what type it was. For more information about how quickly it works as a contraceptive see dosing information below. You should be able to feel the implant under your skin. Tell your doctor if you cannot feel the implant at any time while it is in place. The Nexplanon implant can remain in place for up to 3 years. If the implant is placed correctly, you will not need to use back-up birth control. Follow your doctor's instructions. You may have irregular and unpredictable periods while using Nexplanon. Tell your doctor if your periods are very heavy or long-lasting, or if you miss a period (you may be pregnant). If you need major surgery or will be on long-term bed rest, or if you need medical tests, may need to have your Nexplanon implant removed for a short time. Any doctor or surgeon who treats you should know that you have a Nexplanon implant. Have regular physical exams and mammograms, and self-examine your breasts for lumps on a monthly basis while using this medicine. Call your doctor at once if it feels like the Nexplanon implant may be bent or broken while it is in your arm. To remove the device, your health care provider will inject a local anesthetic in your arm beneath the implant.", "start_char_idx": 404077, "end_char_idx": 408460, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "814ff387-6474-4dc3-9737-daeffc939f1d": {"__data__": {"id_": "814ff387-6474-4dc3-9737-daeffc939f1d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/snows/Desktop/test/drug_info.txt", "file_name": "drug_info.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 766763, "creation_date": "2024-03-31", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-31"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "97210ee2-d555-4d6b-ae33-e4385b58b061", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/snows/Desktop/test/drug_info.txt", "file_name": "drug_info.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 766763, "creation_date": "2024-03-31", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-31"}, "hash": "493e2543f25069f3d0b8bc9bfa3676e74e36c4644acd719e4e83895d2836ba4e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "087ce999-c27f-4fc0-ba12-aa92e305742a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/snows/Desktop/test/drug_info.txt", "file_name": "drug_info.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 766763, "creation_date": "2024-03-31", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-31"}, "hash": "ec282b0c7da2f46137e29184a26f4b42411402a69e714957670d25046825651c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f8af17d4-8d3c-4907-a2e6-db5e04433dab", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "61d1b05a4bd9a606d854f92b9583605189b0e0227242aed0c2836a2371130ea4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "If the implant is placed correctly, you will not need to use back-up birth control.

To remove the device, your health care provider will inject a local anesthetic in your arm beneath the implant. They will make a small incision in your skin and will push the implant toward the incision until the tip is visible and can be grasped with forceps. Your health care provider will then pull out the implant, close the incision and apply a pressure bandage. Contraceptive implant removal typically takes less than five minutes. If you choose, a new device can be implanted as soon as the original device is removed. Be prepared to use another type of contraception right away if you don't have a new device inserted. For information on \u2018Problems with Insertion and Removal\u2019 see the section below called \u2018What are the possible risks of using Nexplanon?\u2019 If your Nexplanon implant is inserted correctly, it is one of the most effective types of birth control. Your chance of getting pregnant is very low, less than 1 pregnancy per 100 women. This medicine may be less effective in overweight women. Yes, you can become pregnant using Nexplanon, but it is very rare. If you do become pregnant it is important to see your healthcare provider to make sure it is not an ectopic pregnancy, which is when the pregnancy is outside of the womb. Women on Nexplanon have a slightly higher risk of ectopic pregnancy compared to women not using birth control. It is important to have the implant removed if you become pregnant and plan on maintaining the pregnancy. This medicine is not likely to cause birth defects if you become pregnant while using it. Nexplanon lasts for 3 years and at the end of the 3 years your implant must be removed. If you still require contraception a new implant may be inserted at the time of removal. You can have Nexplanon removed at any time and you will return to your normal fertility. Detailed Nexplanon dosage information How long before Nexplanon starts to working as a contraceptive depends on if you have previously been using no contraception, or another form of contraception or whether you have recently had a baby, miscarriage or abortion. No previous contraception Previous combination hormonal contraception (eg combined hormonal pills, vaginal ring or transdermal patch) Previous progestin-only contraceptives Previous miscarriage or abortion After giving birth Your fertility will return to normal after removal of Nexplanon, with women in studies becoming pregnant 7 to 14 days after removal. If you do not want to become pregnant then it is important to consider having another Nexplanon inserted at the same time as removal or starting another form of birth control. Nexplanon is an implant that lasts for 3 years. It is not intended for contraceptive use after 3 years and should be replaced with a new one if you want to continue having contraceptive cover. You should keep a record of when you had Nexplanon inserted and just before the end of the third year make an appointment for removal of the implant. You may have your Nexplanon replaced with a new one at the same appointment if you want to continue with contraception.\r\n\r\nDrug Name: Niacin\r\nGeneric Name: Generic name: niacin (nicotinic acid) [\u00a0NYE-a-sin\u00a0]\r\nBrand names: B-3-50, B3-500-Gr, Endur-acin, HDL Benefit, Niacin SR, \r\n... show all 8 brands\r\n\r\nNiacor, Niaspan ER, Slo-Niacin\r\n\r\nDrug classes: Miscellaneous antihyperlipidemic agents, Vitamins\r\nDescription: Niacin , also called nicotinic acid, is a B vitamin (vitamin B3).

Qelbree is a non-stimulant ADHD medicine that may help to improve attention and reduce hyperactivity and impulsiveness. Qelbree is thought to work by increasing levels of norepinephrine, a chemical messenger found in the brain, by blocking a protein called pre-synaptic norepinephrine transporter. ADHD has been associated with low levels of norepinephrine, leading to symptoms such as hyperactivity, impulsivity, and lack of attention, so increasing norepinephrine levels may reduce ADHD symptoms. Qelbree is classified as a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI). Qelbree\u2019s FDA approval was received on April 2, 2021, and it is now indicated for the treatment of ADHD in adults and pediatric patients 6 years and older. Qelbree contains the active ingredient (which is sometimes referred to as the generic name) viloxazine . Common Qelbree side effects in adults are trouble sleeping, headache, sleepiness, tiredness, nausea, decreased appetite, dry mouth, and constipation. Common Qelbree side effects in pediatric patients are sleepiness, decreased appetite, tiredness, nausea, vomiting, trouble sleeping, and irritability. These common side effects occurred in 5% or more of patients, at least twice the rate of patients taking a placebo.

Hereditary angioedema is a rare condition that causes rapid attacks of swelling in areas under the skin around the face, arms, legs, and also the throat, which can be life-threatening if it blocks off the airways.

An IDH1 mutation prevents young blood cells from developing into healthy adult blood cells, which can result in blood and bone marrow disorders such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Tibsovo may be used to treat adults with a confirmed susceptible IDH1 mutation with: Tibsovo targets the IDH1 mutation. In regular cells, the IDH1 gene produces the IDH1 protein, involved in normal cellular chemical processes. However, when the IDH1 gene is modified due to a genetic mutation, it leads to an abnormal version of the IDH1 protein and other substances such as the oncometabolite, D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). Tibsovo decreases levels of 2-HG, reducing blast counts and increasing levels of mature myeloid cells. Blasts are undeveloped bone marrow cells that will later mature into red blood cells, white blood cells, or blood-clotting platelets. They are typically absent in the bloodstream, and their presence signals a bone marrow issue, such as myelodysplastic syndrome. Up to 20% of people with cholangiocarcinoma, and 6% to 10% of people with AML have the IDH1 mutation. Tibsovo was first FDA-approved on July 20, 2018.\r\n\r\nDrug Name: Tirzepatide\r\nGeneric Name: Brand names: Mounjaro, Zepbound\r\nDosage form: Subcutaneous injection (2.5 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 12.5 mg,15 mg per 0.5 mL in single-dose pen)\r\nDrug class: Incretin mimetics\r\nDescription: Tirzepatide is a prescription medicine used for weight loss (Zepbound brand) and type 2 diabetes (Mounjaro brand) in adults.

It is used in adults when the cancer has progressed or has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic) after other treatments have failed. Abemaciclib belongs to a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. Verzenio is a targeted treatment known as a CDK4/6 inhibitor. It works inside the cell to block CDK4/6 activity and help stop the growth of cancer cells. Verzenio is used in combination with an aromatase inhibitor such as anastrozole (Arimidex), exemestane (Aromasin), or letrozole (Femara) to treat a certain type of hormone receptor-positive, early breast cancer. Verzenio is also used along with fulvestrant (Faslodex) to treat a certain type of hormone receptor-positive, advanced breast cancer (breast cancer that depends on hormones such as estrogen to grow) or breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body after treatment with an antiestrogen medication such as tamoxifen. Verzenio is also used along with anastrozole (Arimidex), exemestane (Aromasin), or letrozole (Femara) as a first treatment of hormone receptor-positive, advanced breast cancer or breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. Verzenio is also used alone to treat a certain type of hormone receptor-positive, advanced breast cancer or breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body in people who have already been treated with an antiestrogen medication and chemotherapy. Abemaciclib works by blocking the action of an abnormal protein that signals cancer cells to multiply. This helps slow or stop the spread of cancer cells.

Vitamin E has also been used to treat or prevent macular degeneration (age-related vision loss), a nerve-muscle disorder (ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease ), hardening of the arteries ( atherosclerosis ), atopic dermatitis ( eczema ), cataracts, high blood pressure , liver disease, parkinson's disease , pre-eclampsia, scarring caused by surgery , and pain or stiffness caused by osteoarthritis . However, research has shown that vitamin E may not be effective in treating these conditions. Other uses not proven with research have included asthma , dementia , depression , diabetes , Down syndrome , infertility, inflammatory bowel disease , menopausal symptoms, muscular dystrophy , obesity , osteoporosis , low bone mineral density ( osteopenia ), restless legs syndrome , rheumatoid arthritis , schizophrenia , stroke , sunburn , and uveitis . It is not certain whether vitamin E is effective in treating any medical condition. Medicinal use of this product has not been approved by the FDA. Vitamin E should not be used in place of medication prescribed for you by your doctor. Vitamin E is often sold as an herbal supplement.

Wegovy works by regulating appetite and reducing calorie intake, leading to weight loss, helping with weight management and lowering the risk of heart attacks, strokes and cardiovascular death. Wegovy is a prescription medicine given as an injection once-a-week given under the skin. Wegovy ( semaglutide )belongs to the class of drugs called GLP-1 receptor agonists . GLP-1 receptor agonists are a manufactured version of GLP-1, a naturally occurring hormone in the body that acts in several areas in the brain to regulate food intake. When Wegovy is administered, it activates the GLP-1 receptors in the brain. This lowers appetite, reducing the calories consumed and leading to weight loss. This medicine should be used together with a decreased-calorie meal plan and increased physical activity to help weight management. Wegovy contains semaglutide, which is the same active ingredient in Ozempic and Rybelsus , therefore these products should not be used together.

Welireg is also used to treat advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in certain adults. Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a rare genetic disorder that causes cysts, benign tumors, and malignant tumors to grow in the body due to a mutation in the Von Hippel\u2013Lindau tumor suppressor gene. This change in the gene causes an accumulation in the protein HIF-2a, which is associated with tumor growth. Welireg is a hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) inhibitor that works by blocking HIF-2a, to help reduce tumor growth. Welireg is manufactured for Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. Welireg received FDA approval on August 13, 2021, to treat adult patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease who do not require immediate surgery but require therapy for central nervous system (CNS) hemangioblastomas, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNET), or renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Welireg is manufactured for Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. On December 14,2023, Welireg received FDA approval for the treatment of adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) following a programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) or programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor and a vascular endothelial growth factor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (VEGF-TKI). Common Welireg side effects when taken for VHL disease may include lower hemoglobin, headache , dizziness, tiredness, nausea , increased blood sugar (increased thirst or urination, dry mouth , fruity breath), or abnormal kidney function tests.

It may be used for: Wilate may also be used to treat adults and adolescents aged and older with hemophilia A for: Wilate works by temporarily replacing missing von Willebrand factor (VWF) and coagulation factor VIII (FVIII), in the blood to aid in clotting. VWF promotes platelet aggregation and platelet adhesion on damaged blood vessel walls. It also acts as a carrier protein for the procoagulant protein FVIII, an essential cofactor in the activation of factor X leading to the formation of thrombin and fibrin. Patients suffering from VWD have a deficiency or abnormality of VWF. This reduction in VWF plasma concentration results in correspondingly low FVIII activity and abnormal platelet function, thereby resulting in excessive bleeding. [9] After administration, WILATE temporarily When infused into a patient with hemophilia A, Wilate replaces missing FVIII which then binds to VWF in the patient\u00b4s circulation. Activated FVIII (FVIIIa) acts as a cofactor for activated factor IX (FIXa), accelerating the conversion of factor X to activated factor X (FXa). FXa converts prothrombin into thrombin. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed. By increasing levels of FVIII, Wilate temporarily corrects the factor deficiency, resolving the bleeding tendency. Hemophilia A is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of antihemophilic factor VIII and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles, or internal organs, either spontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma. Wilate was first FDA-approved on December 7, 2009, for von Willebrand\u2019s disease. This approval was expanded to hemophilia A on October 8, 2018.\r\n\r\nDrug Name: Winlevi\r\nGeneric Name: Pronunciation: Win-lev\u0113\r\nGeneric name: clascoterone\r\nDosage form: cream 1%\r\nDrug class: Topical acne agents\r\nDescription: Winlevi cream is a prescription medication for acne vulgaris treatment.

Winrevair (sotatercept) works by binding to activin A (a cytokine that is involved in inflammation, fibrosis, and wound repair that promotes atherosclerotic plaque formation). It also binds to other TGF- \u03b2 superfamily ligands, many of which act on cardiac cells. This action improves the signaling balance and modulates vascular proliferation (the uncontrolled duplication of immature cells), reducing inflammation, and slowing down or reversing the structural tissue changes that happen with PAH. Winrevair was FDA-approved on 26 March 2024.\r\n\r\nDrug Name: Witch Hazel\r\nGeneric Name: Scientific Name(s): Hamamelis virginiana L.Common Name(s): Cortex Hamamelis, Folium Hamamelis, Hamamelis, Hamamelis water, Magician's rod, Snapping hazel, Spotted alder, Tobacco wood, White hazel, Winter bloom, Witch hazel\r\nDescription: Warnings section not found\r\n\r\nDrug Name: Wormwood\r\nGeneric Name: Scientific Name(s): Artemisia absinthium L.Common Name(s): Absinthe, Absinthites, Absinthium, Aci pelin, Ajenjo, Ak pelin, Armoise, B\u00fcy\u00fck pelin, Pelin otu, Vilayati afsanteen, Wermut, Wormwood\r\nDescription: Warnings section not found\r\n\r\nDrug Name: Wynzora\r\nGeneric Name: Pronunciation: win-ZOR-uh\r\nGeneric name: calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate\r\nDosage form: cream\r\nDrug class: Topical antipsoriatics\r\nDescription: Wynzora is a once-daily, topical, fixed-dose combination cream containing calcipotriene 0.005% (a vitamin D analog) and betamethasone dipropionate 0.064% (a corticosteroid) that may be used to treat plaque psoriasis in adults 18 years of age or older.

Xcopri works as an anticonvulsant and can be used on its own to treat partial-onset seizures or can be used together with other anti-seizure medication. Xcopri may decrease the number of partial-onset seizures\u00a0you have, and some people may have their seizures reduced to zero. Partial-onset seizures (sometimes called focal onset seizures) are caused by irregular electrical signals that start in one area of the brain and stay in that one area.\u00a0 The way that Xcopri works to reduce partial-onset seizures is not fully understood, but thought to be related to regulating the irregular electrical brain signals. Yes, Xcopri contains the active ingredient cenobamate which is a Schedule V controlled substance. This means it does have some potential for abuse and if abused may cause limited physical dependence or psychological dependence.\r\n\r\nDrug Name: Xdemvy\r\nGeneric Name: Generic name: lotilaner 0.25% ophthalmic solution\r\nDosage form: eye drops\r\nDrug class: Ophthalmic anti-infectives\r\nDescription: Description section not found\r\n\r\nDrug Name: Xeljanz\r\nGeneric Name: Pronunciation: ZEL\u2019 JANS\u2019\r\nGeneric name: tofacitinib\r\nDosage form: oral tablet, extended-release tablet, oral solution\r\nDrug class: Antirheumatics\r\nDescription: Xeljanz (tofacitinib) is an oral Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor that may be used alone or with other medications to reduce inflammation associated with inflammatory and autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ulcerative colitis.

Approval for this indication was given under the accelerated approval scheme and continued approval may be based on clinical trial results. Not indicated for patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma. Yescarta contains your own T-cells which have been modified in a laboratory. T-cells are a type of white blood cell that are important for your immune response and these are collected by passing your blood through a machine. These separated T-cells are then sent to a laboratory where a special receptor, called a CAR (chimeric antigen receptor) is added to them. CAR improves the ability of your T-cells to latch onto CD19-expressing cancer cells and destroy them. Yescarta is called CD19-directed genetically modified autologous T-cell immunotherapy. The ZUMA-7 study reported a statistically significant improvement in overall survival (OS) for Yescarta compared with standard treatment (SOC) when Yescarta is used to treat relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma within 12 months of completion of first-line treatment. The estimated 39-month OS rates were 55.9% in the Yescarta arm and 46% in the SOC arm. Yescarta was FDA-approved on October 18, 2017.\r\n\r\nDrug Name: Yohimbe\r\nGeneric Name: Generic name not found\r\nDescription: Warnings section not found\r\n\r\nDrug Name: Yondelis\r\nGeneric Name: Generic name: trabectedin [\u00a0tra-BEK-te-din\u00a0]\r\nDrug class: Alkylating agents\r\nDescription: Yondelis is a cancer medicine that interferes with the growth and spread of cancer cells in the body.

Zeposia helps to reduce the relapse rate and the number and size of brain lesions in multiple sclerosis. For ulcerative colitis, Zeposia is used to reduce symptoms, and it can also help achieve and maintain remission. Zeposia is FDA-approved to treat adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis and also FDA-approved to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis, including clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and active secondary progressive disease. Multiple sclerosis and ulcerative colitis are both autoimmune disorders where the immune cells (lymphocytes) are thought to incorrectly start attacking your healthy tissue, thinking that it is a foreign substance. In multiple sclerosis, the immune system attacks and damages the myelin sheath that covers the nerves in the brain and spinal cord (CNS). This disrupts the brain from sending signals to the rest of the body and causes symptoms including numbness and tingling in the face, arms, feet, and legs, balance issues and trouble walking, vision problems, bowel and bladder problems, fatigue, and problems thinking and concentrating. In ulcerative colitis, the immune system attacks and causes inflammation in the lining of the colon which causes the symptoms of abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, bowel urgency, diarrhea, and tiredness. Zeposia is thought to work by preventing immune cells (lymphocytes) from entering the intestines and central nervous system (CNS). It does this by trapping the immune cells in the lymph nodes, which may stop them from causing harmful inflammation in the CNS (in the case of multiple sclerosis) and the colon (in the case of ulcerative colitis). By reducing inflammation that would have been caused by the lymphocytes, the symptoms of these conditions may improve.", "start_char_idx": 743989, "end_char_idx": 748252, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f1af8e5d-9fad-423c-983a-29aba12ff769": {"__data__": {"id_": "f1af8e5d-9fad-423c-983a-29aba12ff769", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/snows/Desktop/test/drug_info.txt", "file_name": "drug_info.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 766763, "creation_date": "2024-03-31", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-31"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "97210ee2-d555-4d6b-ae33-e4385b58b061", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/snows/Desktop/test/drug_info.txt", "file_name": "drug_info.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 766763, "creation_date": "2024-03-31", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-31"}, "hash": "493e2543f25069f3d0b8bc9bfa3676e74e36c4644acd719e4e83895d2836ba4e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3fea767d-e384-4676-ba8c-53fd69387eab", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/snows/Desktop/test/drug_info.txt", "file_name": "drug_info.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 766763, "creation_date": "2024-03-31", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-31"}, "hash": "c0cd572477322d73737125b3592238db7db753bc846bb1dea1e6c87e61a6e5af", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6ad147e9-dd77-42b1-a81f-1b7ebd6c1b69", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3af72aa9680479d8631bc4e515c50efd30594fb25b3b4aba4ff207cf92bd4848", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "This disrupts the brain from sending signals to the rest of the body and causes symptoms including numbness and tingling in the face, arms, feet, and legs, balance issues and trouble walking, vision problems, bowel and bladder problems, fatigue, and problems thinking and concentrating.
